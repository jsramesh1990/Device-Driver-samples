# Chapter Opening

Linux, a free and open-source operating system, has become central in cloud computing, AI, containerization, and serverless technologies.
Its open nature allows developers worldwide to explore, modify, and contribute, accelerating its growth and innovation.
Device drivers act as a bridge between software and hardware, hiding hardware complexity and enabling modular development.
Writing Linux kernel drivers is an excellent entry point for learning kernel internals, including process, memory, and VFS management.
The examples in this book illustrate common Linux drivers, helping readers gain practical understanding and enjoy Linux development.
